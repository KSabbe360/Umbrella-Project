# Umbrella-Project
A final project for ME 351 (Intro to Instrumentation). ellThe SolMate Umbra project is a tech-driven solution for automated sun tracking using an umbrella. It features an embedded system that employs photoresistors (KLS6-3537) for sunlight detection and uses an Adafruit Stepper Motor (PM 918) and an SG90 Servo Motor for dynamic positioning. The codebase includes routines for sensor data acquisition, filtering via a median algorithm, and control logic for the actuators. This project demonstrates practical applications of sensor integration, motor control, and state management in an automated physical system.
